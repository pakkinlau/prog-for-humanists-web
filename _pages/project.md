Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting problem in the context of a real-world data sets.
Projects should be done in teams of three students.
Each project will be assigned a TA as a project consultant/mentor; instructors and TAs will consult with you on your ideas, but of course the final responsibility to define and execute an interesting piece of work is yours. Your project will be worth 46% of your final class grade, and will have 4 deliverables:

1. **Proposal** : 2 pages excluding references (10%)
2. **Midway Report** : 5 pages excluding references (20%)
3. **Presentation** : poster presentation (20%)
4. **Final Report** : 8 pages excluding references (50%)
