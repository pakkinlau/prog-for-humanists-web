| Grade A-| Generally outstanding performance on all (or almost all) learning outcomes.                                           |
| Grade B | Substantial performance on all learning outcomes, OR high performance on some learning outcomes which compensates for less satisfactory performance on others, resulting in overall substantial performance. |
| Grade C | Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, possibly with a few weaknesses.                         |
| Grade D | Barely satisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes.                                                      |
| Grade F | Unsatisfactory performance on a number of learning outcomes, OR failure to meet specified assessment requirements.       |

### Assessment and assignments

**10% Attendance and Participation in Lecture**

Students are expected to attend and contribute to lectures. Students are also expected to do the set reading ahead of class and do any set homework exercises.  Although students will become expert in only one or two digital methods, they must learn the rudiments of all the methods covered.

N.B. Students will also be expected to attend at least three meetings of the digital humanities seminar (advertised on the Faculty of Arts website), as well as office hours on at least one occasion.

**10% Weekly Response Paper**

10x 200-word response papers for weeks 2-12.  These should answer the question: “How is this week’s tool(s) useful for creating or disseminating historical insights?”  Please answer with reference to the specific skills you have learned from doing the tutorials. Post on Blackboard forum.  Due by Thursday 9am each week (absolute deadline).

**30% Discussion in tutorial (7.5% each tutorial)**

In each of the tutorials, each of the subgroups will collectively present their ideas/progress (in the form of a PowerPoint with relevant data/visualizations/etc.) and seek feedback from other students.   Each tutorial will be devoted to a different stage of [project management](https://hbr.org/2016/11/the-four-phases-of-project-management#:~:text=Whether%20you're%20in%20charge,up%2C%20implementation%2C%20and%20closeout.): planning, build-up, implementation, closeout.

**50% Final Group Project**

The class project will be carried out in groups of 3 or 4 people, and has four main parts: 

A) Data preparation and data wrangling;
B) Machine learning with tensorflow;
C) Database setups with mongoDB database;
D) Project deployments with streamlit

The project is an integral part of this class, and is designed to be as similar as possible to creating a data-driven humanity research project.  


Please see the [project page](google.com) for more information about the final project.

Depending on numbers, students will be divided into small groups, each responsible for a different element, e.g. data/visualizations, maps, app, video, website (+overall coordination), programming component (if someone particularly wants to learn this), etc. Students should communicate regularly and I suggest you set up a Whatsapp group for this purpose.  Each group will keep a project diary (also called [learning log](http://www.knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/media/6877765/lf%20learning%20log.doc?fbclid=IwAR0HCN7bPp7Dx6vUugmVe3KVWvqhPtsO3FjqrW8nuyfygb86zl_yzMtBJf4#:~:text=A%20Learning%20Log%20is%20a,record%20of%20your%20own%20learning.)) of which methods they learned, how many times/how long they communicated, collaborated, how they organized their time/effort/etc.   

Grade will be based on both the collaboration/teamwork process (20% based on learning log) and the final product (30% based on the project).
